# Quantconnect-notes


This repository tracks my personal journey learning algorithmic trading using the QuantConnect engine.

I started exploring QuantConnect in July 2025 with the goal of understanding how systematic trading strategies are built, tested, and evaluated in a professional-grade environment.

I want to

- Understand the structure of algorithmic strategies
- Learn how to implement signals and indicators in Lean
- Explore realistic backtesting constraints (slippage, warm-ups, rebalancing)
- Evaluate strategies with meaningful performance metrics (Sharpe, drawdown, volatility)

| 2025-07-29  | Started QuantConnect, watching intro + strategy videos |



Iâ€™ll gradually add:
- Prototype strategies (momentum, mean reversion, volatility)
- Notebooks summarizing results
- Code snippets for key Lean concepts
